stab for R: data analysis of drug stability for shelf life estimation


04/11/2013 (v0.1.5)
---
 - switched from solving a quadratic eq. for shelf-life
   to graphic method (95% CI);

 - thus we fixed inconsitent results between calculated
   shlef-life and the list of 95% CI for multiple batches;

 - outputs have been directed to a .txt and .pdf files;
   .txt is for statistical results, and .pdf is for
   graphic output.
   
 - the demo still keeps as it was; i.e., using the method
   of solving quadratic eq. for historical reasons.
  
 - add the examples from the textbook, as well as to 
   validate stab for R.
   
 - since stab v0.1.4 was just released on March 7, 2013,
   we have to wait for two more months before next release.
   hoever, this 'pre-release' has been finished and is ready
   to release. Once it has been submitted to CRAN and
   has been accepted by CRAN core team, this pre-release
   will be removed from here.
   
 - thanks for using stab for R.
